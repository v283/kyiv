  <h2>Usage of Should, shouldn't</h2>
  <h4>Giving advice</h4>
  <p>We use <strong>should</strong> or <strong>shouldn 't </strong>to give somebody advice and to say what is or isn 't the right thing to do.</p>
  <ul>
  <li> You look tired. You<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong> should have</strong></span> some rest.  </li>
  <li> He <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>shouldn 't drive</strong></span> so fast. He 'll have an accident one day.  </li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong>I think you should ...</strong></h4>
  <p>We often say <strong>I think ... should</strong> <strong>...</strong> to give somebody advice.</p>
  <ul>
  <li> <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>I think you should buy</strong> </span>a new pair of shoes for the party.  </li>
  <li> <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>I think we should go</strong></span> home; it 's very late.  </li>
  </ul>
  <p><span class="highlighter">Note</span> that in a negative sentence, we often say <strong>I don 't think ... should ...</strong> (NOT <del>I think ... shouldn 't ...</del>)</p>
  <ul>
  <li> <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>I don 't think you should call</strong></span> her now; she 's very upset.  (NOT <del> I think you shouldn 't call her </del>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We often say <strong>Do you think ... should ... </strong>to ask for advice.</p>
  <ul>
  <li> <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>Do you think I should look</strong></span> for another apartment? </li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong>Ought to, ought not to</strong></h4>
  <p>We can also use <strong>ought to</strong> instead of <strong>should</strong>, and <strong>ought not to</strong> instead of <strong>shouldn 't</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
  <li> You <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>ought to have</strong></span> some rest. </li>
  <li> He <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>ought not to drive</strong></span> so fast.  </li>
  </ul>
