  <h2>Stative Verbs</h2>

  <p><strong>Stative</strong> or <strong>non-action</strong> verbs are verbs that describe a <strong>state</strong> or
    <strong>condition</strong> rather than an action. As a state has no real beginning or end, stative verbs are only
    used with <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>perfect</strong> tenses. They cannot be used with
    <strong>continuous</strong> tenses.
  </p>
  <p>These are some of the <strong>most common </strong>verbs that refer to states or conditions, so they are
    <strong>stative verbs</strong>.
  </p>
  <h4>Possession and size.</h4>
  <p>Examples: <strong>belong, own, have </strong>(meaning ‘possess’)<strong>, possess, weigh, measure</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ali<span style="color: #50af31;"> <strong>owns</strong> </span>three cars. </li>
    <li><del>Ali <span style="color: #ed1c24;"><strong>is owning </strong></span>three cars.</del><br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Opinion</h4>
  <p>Examples: <strong>know, believe agree, think </strong>(meaning ‘believe’ or ‘have an opinion’)<strong>, imagine,
      understand</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I <span style="color: #50af31;"><strong>know </strong></span>what the answer is. </li>
    <li><del>I <span style="color: #ed1c24;"><strong>am</strong> <strong>knowing </strong></span>what the answer is.
      </del> </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Likes and dislikes, feelings and emotions.</h4>
  <p>Examples: <strong>like, love, want, need, wish, prefer, dislike</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sam<span style="color: #50af31;"> <strong>likes</strong></span> vegetables.</li>
    <li><del>Sam <span style="color: #ed1c24;"><strong>is liking
          </strong></span>vegetables<strong>.</strong></del></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Perception and the senses.</h4>
  <p>Examples: <strong>sound, hear, seem, see*, appear*, look*, taste*, smell*, feel*</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It<span style="color: #50af31;"> <strong>smells</strong></span> good. </li>
    <li><del>It <span style="color: #ed1c24;"><strong>is smelling
          </strong></span>good<strong>.</strong></del></li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>* </strong>Although they are usually used as <strong>stative</strong> verbs, these verbs can also be
    <strong>dynamic </strong>when they are used to describe <strong>voluntary actions</strong>, not perceptions.<br>
     
  </p>
  <h2>Dynamic Verbs</h2>
  <p><strong>Dynamic verbs</strong> are verbs which describe an<strong> action</strong>,<strong> change</strong> or
    <strong>process </strong>that has a beginning and an end. They are the most common type of verb and can be used in
    all tenses and aspects.
  </p>
  <p>When referring to an action that is or was in progress, we use <strong>dynamic</strong> verbs with a
    <strong>continuous</strong> tense.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>am eating</strong></span> breakfast now.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>However, when referring to habits or things that are always true, we use them with a <strong>simple</strong>
    tense.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>eat</strong></span> breakfast at the same time
      each day.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here are some common verbs that refer to actions, not states, so they are<strong> dynamic </strong>and can be
    used in both <strong>simple</strong> and<strong> continuous</strong> tenses: <strong>eat, run, swim, speak, talk,
      walk, sleep, make, cook, come, go, buy, sit, watch, listen, do, play, say, read, write, stand, bring, take,
      give, jump, drive, ride, climb, fly, fall, cry, drink, send, kiss, wear, smell*, taste*, feel*, look*</strong>.
  </p>
  <p><strong>*</strong> Both stative.<br>
     </p>
  <h2>Verbs which are both stative and dynamic</h2>
  <p>Some verbs can be both <strong>stative</strong> and <strong>dynamic</strong>. Here are some common examples.</p>
  <h4><strong>Have</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>Have</strong>, meaning ‘to possess’, describes a state, so it is a<strong> stative</strong> verb.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>have</strong></span> two cats.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>But</strong> when <strong>have </strong>doesn’t mean ‘to possess’, it describes an action, so it is a
    <strong>dynamic</strong> verb.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>They are <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>having </strong></span>a party on Saturday.</li>
    <li>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>was having</strong></span> dinner when someone knocked at the
      door.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong>Be</strong></h4>
  <p>The verb <strong>be </strong>is normally used to describe a state, so it is a <strong>stative
    </strong>verb.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>James <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>is </strong></span>a doctor.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But when <strong>be</strong> means ‘to act or behave’, it describes an action, so it is a
    <strong>dynamic</strong> verb.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>He <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>is being</strong></span> very kind to us.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong>Think</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>Think</strong>, meaning ‘to believe’ or ‘to have an opinion’, describes a state, so it is a
    <strong>stative</strong> verb.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>think </strong></span>it is a good idea.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Think</strong>, meaning ‘to use your brain to reflect”, is an action, so it is a <strong>dynamic</strong>
    verb</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sara <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>is thinking</strong></span> about her boyfriend.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong>Look</strong></h4>
  <p><strong>Look</strong>, meaning ‘to appear’, is a state, so it is a <strong>stative</strong> verb.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Tom <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>looks </strong></span>like his sister.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Look</strong>, meaning ‘to focus the eyes on something’, is an action, so it is a <strong>dynamic
    </strong>verb.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Peter <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>is looking </strong></span>out the window.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4><strong>Taste, see, smell, feel</strong></h4>
  <p>Although they are usually classified as <strong>stative</strong>, some verbs of the senses (e.g., <strong>taste,
      see, smell, feel</strong>) can also be <strong>dynamic</strong> when they refer to <strong>voluntary
      actions</strong> and not perceptions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>This soup <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>tastes</strong></span> horrible. (=Perception, not
      voluntary.)</li>
    <li>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>am tasting</strong></span> the soup. (=Voluntary action
      meaning ‘to put food in your mouth to see how it tastes’.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <ul>
    <li>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>saw</strong></span> a man looking through a window. (=Not
      voluntary)</li>
    <li>Tom <strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">is seeing</span></strong> Katie this afternoon. (Voluntary
      action meaning ‘to meet or visit someone’)</li>
  </ul>
