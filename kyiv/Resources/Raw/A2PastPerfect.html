  <p>The Past Perfect is formed with had and the past participle. </p>
  <h3>Usage of Present Simple:</h3>
  <p>We use Past Perfect to talk about what happened before another event in the past. It is used with the Past Simple.
  </p>

  <p>At the airport I realised that I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>had left</strong></span> my passport at
    home.
    <br>(I left my passport at home before I went to the airport.)
  </p>
  <h2>Be careful with this common mistake!</h2>
  <p>The contraction <strong>&#8216;d</strong> can be <strong>had</strong> or <strong>would</strong>. Remember that we
    use an infinitive form after <strong>would</strong> and a past participle after <strong>had</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
