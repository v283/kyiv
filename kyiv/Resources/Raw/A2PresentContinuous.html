  <h2>Present continuous (future arrangements)</h2>
  <p>We often use the present continuous to talk about the future, especially about future plans when we
    have <strong>decided a time and a place</strong> with other people. We normally use a future time
    expression, e.g. <strong>tomorrow</strong>, <strong>next week, at 8,</strong> <strong>etc</strong>.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I’<strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">m meeting</span></strong> Sally at 8. (=I have talked to her
      and we have arranged to meet.)</li>
    <li>I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m flying</strong></span> to New
        York tomorrow morning. (=I have the ticket.)</li>
    <li>We’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>re getting married</strong></span> next July. (=We have
      decided it and we have probably already made reservations for the restaurant, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The present continuous for future arrangements is very common with verbs of travelling, and when we are meeting
    people.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m leaving</strong></span> very early tomorrow. I’<span
          style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m taking</strong></span> the 8.30 train. </li>
    <li>I’<strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">m playing</span></strong> golf with Jack next Saturday. Would you
        like to come?</li>
    <li>I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m seeing</strong></span> the dentist after class. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>Present continuous vs <strong>be going to</strong></h2>
  <p>We can normally use the present continuous or <strong>be going to</strong> to talk about future plans.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m leaving</strong></span> very early tomorrow. </li>
    <li>I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m going to leave</strong></span> very early tomorrow.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>But we prefer using the present continuous when we have made <strong>arrangements</strong> (i.e. decided a
    place and time with somebody else). When use <strong>be going to</strong>, we put the emphasis on our
    <strong>intention</strong> to do something.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m going to study</strong></span> for the exams tomorrow.
      (=it’s my intention)</li>
    <li>I’<strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">m leaving</span></strong> at 8 tomorrow. (=it’s an
      arrangement)</li>
    <li>‘Your car is dirty.’ ‘I know. I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m going to wash</strong></span> it
        tomorrow.’ (=it’s my intention, but I haven’t arranged to do it)</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><strong>Will</strong> for decisions</h2>
  <p>Use <strong>will</strong> for decisions that you take at the moment of speaking (instant decisions).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>‘Oh, we don’t have sugar.’ ‘Don’t worry, I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>ll buy</strong></span>
        some.’</li>
  </ul>
  <p> </p>
  <h2><strong>Be going to</strong> or <strong>will</strong> for predictions</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>be going to</strong> or <strong>will</strong> (NOT the present continuous) to make
    predictions about the future. </span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>I think he’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>ll win</strong> </span>the election.</li>
    <li>The doctor said I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m going to have</strong></span> a girl.</li>
  </ul>
