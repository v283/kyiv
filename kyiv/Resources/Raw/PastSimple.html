        <h3>Usage of Past Simple</h3>
        <p>We use the Past Simple to talk about things which started and finished in the past, including: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>single events: I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>started</strong></span> school in 1993.</li>
            <li>regular events: I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>walked</strong></span> to school every day.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>We can add time expressions like yesterday, yesterday
          morning/afternoon/evening, last night/year/week!
          Saturday, when I was five, ten years ago.</p>

        <h3>Past Simple Wh- questions </h3>
