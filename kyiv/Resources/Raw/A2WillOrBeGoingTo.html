  <h2>Will vs be going to</h2>
  <h2>Predictions</h2>
  <p>Use <strong>will</strong> to talk about something that you think will happen. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I think he’<strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">ll win</span></strong> the election.</li>
    <li>He <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>will be</strong></span> a good teacher.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use <strong>be going to</strong> to talk about something that you see is going to happen (there is present
    evidence).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Don’t drive like a crazy man. We’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>re going to have</strong></span> an
        accident!</li>
    <li>The doctor said I’<strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">m going to have</span></strong> a girl.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Sometimes there's little difference between <strong>will </strong> and <strong>be going to </strong>for
    predictions. Compare:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The conference starts in 10 minutes. We <strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">are going to
            be</span></strong> late. (=I can <strong>see</strong> that we cannot be at the conference in 10
      minutes)</li>
    <li>We need to hurry up. We'll be late for the conference. (=I <strong>think</strong> we will be
      late)</li>
  </ul>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Decisions</h2>
  <p>Use <strong>will</strong> for decisions that you take at the moment of speaking (instant decisions).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>‘Oh, we don’t have sugar.’ ‘Don’t worry, I’<strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">ll buy</span></strong>
        some.’</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use <strong>be going to</strong> for decisions that you have already taken at the moment of speaking (intentions or
    plans).</p>
  <ul>
    <li>‘Why are you undressing?’ ‘Because I’<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m going to go</strong></span> for
        a swim.’</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Compare these two sentences:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>'Ann said she needs to talk to you.' 'Oh, I didn't know. I'<span
          style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>ll call her</strong></span> in a minute.' (=I took the decision
      <strong>while</strong> having this conversation.)</li>
    <li>'Ann said she needs to talk to you.' 'Yes, I know. I'<span
          style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>m going to call her</strong></span> in a minute.' (=I took the
      decision <strong>before</strong> having this conversation.)</li>
  </ul>
