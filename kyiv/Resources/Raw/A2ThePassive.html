  <p>We form the Passive with the verb to be and the past participle of the verb. </p>
  <h3>Usage of Present Simple:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>We use the Passive when the action or the object is more important than the person or thing which does the
      action:
      <br>English <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>is spoken</strong></span> all over the world.
    </li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Using by:</h3>
  <p>We can use by to say who or what is responsible for the action:</p>



  <ul>
    <li>The painting was bought <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>by a very rich American</strong></span>. </li>
    <li>Penicillin was invented <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>by Alexander Fleming</strong></span>.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Wh-questions:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>How</strong></span> is pasta made? </li>
    <li><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>When</strong></span> was America discovered?</li>
    <li><span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>Why</strong></span> has the music been turned off?</li>
  </ul>
